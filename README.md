Welcome to the Titanic Survival Prediction App, a machine learning web application built using Streamlit, which predicts whether a passenger would have survived the tragic Titanic disaster.

This app is powered by a Logistic Regression model trained on the historical Titanic dataset. It takes user inputs like age, gender, class, fare, and other features to make a real-time prediction.

✨ Features
📊 Interactive Input Form Enter details such as age, passenger class, gender, fare, and family aboard to get instant predictions.

🧠 ML Model Powered Uses a Logistic Regression model trained with proper preprocessing, scaling, and label encoding.

🛠️ Robust Backend Includes data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding, scaling) and model persistence using pickle.

📦 Modular & Clean Code Organized with separate files for the model, scaler, encoders, and app logic.
